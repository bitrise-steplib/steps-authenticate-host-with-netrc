summary: |-
  Adds your authentication configuration to the `.netrc` file.

  [This Step](https://github.com/bitrise-steplib/steps-authenticate-host-with-netrc) adds the authentication configuration (host name, login name and password string) to the `.netrc` file .
  The Step, for example, makes it easy to use HTTPS git clone URLs with, let's say, OAuth token based authentication, instead of authenticating with SSH key.
  Please note that if you already have a `.netrc` file, the Step will create a backup of the original, and appends the configs to the current one.

  ### Configuring the Step
  1.Add the **Host** name, where the username and password will be used, for example, github.com.
  2.Add the **Username**.
  3.Add the password or the authentication token/ access token in the respective field which will be used by the host to authenticate you.
